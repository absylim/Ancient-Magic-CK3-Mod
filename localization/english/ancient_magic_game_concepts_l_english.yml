 game_concept_mage_level: "Mage Level"
 game_concept_mage_level_desc: "The level of a spell caster is a somewhat arbitrary means of categorizing and describing the capabilities of a [GetTrait('mage').GetName( GetNullCharacter ) |LVl]. The more powerful the mage, the higher their level may be said to be. In general, the higher a spell caster's mage level, the more effective their spells will be.\n\nThe rate at which a spell caster's mage level increases is dependent on the [magic_potential|E] inherent in the blood of that individual. More potent spell casters will gain mage levels more quickly than those with less natural aptitude."

 game_concept_mana: "Mana"
 game_concept_mana_i: "@aura_icon_active!"
 game_concept_mana_desc: "Mana is a fundamental force in the universe. It is a raw expression of 'potential' which may be used by a skilled magical practitioner to bend the laws of reality to their will.\n\nWhenever a mage casts a spell, they are channeling this 'potential' into an outcome of their own choosing, expending their mana reserves in the process. The more powerful an effect a [GetTrait('mage').GetName( GetNullCharacter ) |LVl] wishes to bring about, the more mana that effect requires."

 game_concept_mana_gen_desc: "A mage can only hold so much magical potential within their body. Once it has been spent (for example, while casting a spell) the mage must then wait for the mana stores within their body to replenish. The higher a mage's [magic_potential|E], the faster their mana regenerates. Their [mage_level|E] also plays an indirect part in increasing the amount of mana they generate."

 game_concept_chiromancy_i: "@chiromancy_icon!"
 game_concept_chiromancy_desc: "Chiromancy is the [school_of_magic|E] focusing on the manipulation of energy within the bodies of living things. It is part of the same magical tradition as the schools of [biomancy|E] and [elomancy|E], and the three schools differ mostly in their areas of interest and the ways their spells are used, rather than in how the [GetTrait('mage').GetName( GetNullCharacter ) |LVl] conceptualizes their spell constructs.

 game_concept_elomancy: "Elomancy"
 game_concept_elomancy_i: "@elomancy_icon!"
 game_concept_elomancy_desc: "Elomancy is the [school_of_magic|E] focusing on harnessing the forces of nature to produce an effect, often of a destructive nature. [GetTrait('mage').GetName( GetNullCharacter ) |LV]#V s#! who specialize in this discipline are able to summon fire, cold, electricity, and other manifestations of natural power to harm or hamper their enemies. They may also infuse these energies into golems, which they use as soldiers. As [elomancer|E]#E s#! develop their abilities, they become more and more adept at manipulating these forces."

 game_concept_necromancy_desc: "Necromancy is the [school_of_magic|E] focusing on harnessing and manipulating the force of entropy and decay. It is a distinct magical practice, with its own traditions which vary greatly from the more elemental schools. [GetTrait('mage').GetName( GetNullCharacter ) |LVl]#V s#! which become practitioners of this area of study gain the ability to manipulate these energies in ever more sophisticated ways.

 game_concept_biomancy: "Biomancy"
 game_concept_biomancy_i: "@biomancy_icon!"
 game_concept_biomancy_desc: "Biomancy is the [school_of_magic|E] focusing on the manipulation of living things, not to heal, but in an effort change, either perfecting or damaging their targets at will.

 game_concept_mensomancy_i: "@mensomancy_icon!"
 game_concept_mensomancy_desc: "Mensomancy is the [school_of_magic|E] focusing on manipulating the minds of other conscious beings. Novice practitioners of this school may use it to alter the moods and feelings of those around themselves, manipulating their target's mind and actions in subtle ways.

Though it is said that there are other ways a practitioner may learn to harness magical power, the six magic schools and their traditions have stood the test of time as the most efficient and practical means of understanding and manipulating [mana|E].\n\nWhen a [GetTrait('mage').GetName( GetNullCharacter ) |LVl] speaks about a school of magic, they are not referring to a physical place. What they are referring to is a structured mental framework or state which a mage may enter to facilitate a particular form of spell casting."

 game_concept_undead: "Undead"
 game_concept_undead_desc: "The undead are people and animals which have died and been reanimated by [necromancy|E]. Most undead, called 'lesser undead' to distinguish them from more sophisticated beings are mindless creatures which only follow whatever instructions their creator invests them with at the time of their creation.\n\nTrue masters of the necromantic arts are able to create more complex forms of undeath, however. These beings, called 'greater undead' retain much of their mind and volition, though are usually still slaves to the spell caster that created them. The exception to this rule is the líché, a powerful undead spell caster which, due to their magical ability, is able to retain their mind and volition, even after their transformation from a living being into an undead creature. Powerful necromancers often choose to pursue this path to immortality, or to impart it on their favored subjects and family."

 #Holding
 game_concept_city_of_magic: "City Of Magic"
 game_concept_city_of_magic_desc: "A city of magic is a domain where magic has become ubiquitous and harnessed in service to man. It is a place where day-to-day affairs, such as the growing of food, the administration of the domain, security, and architecture, are improved through the use of magic.\n\nCities of magic are, by their nature, wonders of the world, with spells being used for all manner of simple tasks such as lighting, utilities, pest control, criminal science, and communication. In a city of magic, the arcane touches nearly every aspect of mundane life, and all benefit from this contact."

 #Ley Lines
 game_concept_ley_line: "Ley Line"
 game_concept_ley_line_desc: "[mana|E] is ubiquitous, but some places, called ley lines, have greater concentrations of it than others. Among the magically educated, there is some debate about the nature and cause of ley lines, and no consensus has ever been reached about their origin.\n\nWhat is known is that ley lines do indeed appear to move along defined paths. They are all connected, sweeping across the planet in great flows of magical energy, occasionally intersecting at points called [focal_points|E], and allow a spell caster to draw more mana than they would otherwise be able to."
 game_concept_ley_lines: "Ley Lines"
 game_concept_focal_point: "Focal Point"
 game_concept_focal_point_desc: "Among scholars of the arcane, a focal point is a geographical area where two or more [ley_lines|E] intersect. They are the most magically active places on earth, with each convergent ley line radically increasing the ambient [mana|E] of the region.\n\nAny [GetTrait('mage').GetName( GetNullCharacter ) |LVl] who finds themselves in control of one of these wondrous places will find it easier to gather and use magical energies. At the greatest of focal points, the very fabric of reality is so weak that the supernatural becomes the norm, though thankfully, such places are exceedingly rare."

 ## Spell Descriptions
 game_concept_mage_spell: "Spell"
 game_concept_mage_spells: "Spells"
 game_concept_mage_spell_desc: "When a [GetTrait('mage').GetName( GetNullCharacter ) |LV] casts a spell, they are drawing on years of training to put themselves into a certain state of mind. While not necessary, due to the complexity of even the most simple spells, mages often use specific spell mnemonics - words and gestures which help them to remember the state of mind a spell requires.\n\nOnce the mage has achieved the necessary state of mind, they "cast" this spell out into the world around them. The ability to "cast" is what distinguishes those with [GetTrait('magic_potential_1').GetName( GetNullCharacter ) |LV] from everyone else in the world. Anyone can achieve the frame of mind required to construct a spell, but only mages may "cast" their thoughts and will into the world around them, a process known as creating a spell construct."
 game_concept_mage_aura: "Aura"
 game_concept_mage_aura_desc: "All auras are [mage_spells|E], but not all spells are auras. An aura is a type of spell that represents an on-going shift in that practioner's frame of mind, as well as a constant expenditure of [mana|E], which the [GetTrait('mage').GetName( GetNullCharacter ) |LVl] uses to sustain the spell. In order to activate an aura, a mage must have enough mana to cast the spell, and they must be able to produce enough mana each month to sustain it."
 game_concept_mage_ritual: "Ritual"
 game_concept_mage_ritual_desc: "A ritual is a type of spell which is more complex than any one human mind can quickly, safely, or accurately conceive of, at least not without significant preparations, advanced tools, multiple casters, or any combination of these elements. Like aura spells, a ritual may typically only be cast on or near the [GetTrait('mage').GetName( GetNullCharacter ) |LVl] who casts it. Unlike auras, however, rituals do not require that a mage continually maintain them in order for the spell to be effective. They simply produce whatever effects they are designed to produce, then dissipate like any other spell.\n\nThough a ritual is sometimes used because the spell being cast requires more power than one mage may contain on their own, this is not the primary use of a ritual style spell. More often, they are used to cast spells which are, by their nature, prohibitively complex, such as those which are necessary for the creation of golems, the undead, or any other being with some semblence of a mind. It is simply not feasible to produce a construct of any complexity without using an equally complex spell construct to define the parameters of the creatures' behavior."
