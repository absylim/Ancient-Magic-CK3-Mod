In general, the higher a spell caster's mage level, the more effective their spells will be.\n\nThe rate at which a spell caster's mage level increases is dependent on the [magic_potential|E] inherent in the blood of that individual.

 ## Spell Descriptions
 game_concept_mage_spell:0 "Spell"
 game_concept_mage_spell_desc:0 "When a [GetTrait('mage').GetName( GetNullCharacter ) |LV] says that they are casting a spell, what they mean is that they are drawing on years of training to put themselves into a certain state of mind. While not necessary, due to the complexity of even the most simple spells, most mages often uses specific spell mnemonics - words and gestures which help them to remember the state of mind a spell requires.\n\nOnce the mage has achieved the necessary state of mind, they "cast" this spell out into the world around them. The ability to "cast" is what distinguishes those with [GetTrait('magic_potential_1').GetName( GetNullCharacter ) |LV] from everyone else in the world. At the end of the day, anyone can achieve the frame of mind required to construct a spell, but only mages may "cast" their thoughts and will into the world around them, a process known as creating a spell construct."

 game_concept_mage_aura_desc:0 "All auras are [mage_spell|E]#E s#!, but not all spells are auras. An aura is a type of spell that a mage may usually only cast on themself. It represents an on-going shift in that practioner's frame of mind, as well as a constant expenditure of [mana|E], which the [GetTrait('mage').GetName( GetNullCharacter ) |LVl] uses to sustain the spell. In order to activate an aura, a mage must have enough mana to cast the spell, and they must be able to produce enough mana each month to sustain it."
 game_concept_mage_ritual:0 "Ritual"
 game_concept_mage_ritual_desc:0 "A ritual is a type of spell which is more complex than any one human mind can quickly, safely, or accurately conceive of, at least not without significant preparations, advanced tools, multiple casters, or any combination of these elements. Like aura spells, a ritual may typically only be cast on or near the [GetTrait('mage').GetName( GetNullCharacter ) |LVl] which casts them. Unlike auras, however, rituals do not require that a mage continually maintain them in order for the spell to be effective. They simply produce whatever effects they are designed to produce, then dissipate like any other spell.\n\nThough a ritual is sometimes used because the spell being cast requires more power than one mage may contain on their own, this is not the primary use of a ritual style spell. More often, they are used to cast spells which are, by their nature, prohibitively complex, such as those which are necessary for the creation of golems, the undead, or any other being with some semblence of a mind. It is simply not feasible to produce a construct of any complexity without using an equally complex spell construct to define the parameters of such creature's behavior."
