This ritual creates materilised soul in this plane of existence by combining mana with ones conciousness which is also one of the main reasons its so risky, but if one is succesfull in this ritual, then the reward is being closer to being truly immortall, as only by matterilising ones soul can one stop being limited by their own mortal shell. This will for example allow one to stop being limitied by their memory capacity."
