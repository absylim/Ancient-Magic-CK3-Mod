 ancient_magic_alchemy.0001.t: "Build Laboratory: Location"
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0001.desc: "Secrecy is of great importance as the experiments I will perform in my laboratory may both frighten the ignorant and tantalize my fellow alchemists a magic forgers. To keep intruders away laboratories are often built deep within a castle, but a more accessible building would likely be more efficient..."
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0001.a: "My secrets will be safe deep within the walls of [GetCapitalLocation.GetTitle.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]!"
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0001.b: "Let us build an efficient and accessible office for research!"

 ancient_magic_alchemy.0001.d: "Let us build a remote guarded compound."
 hidden_lab_tooltip: "The plans for your laboratory will have to fit into your existing castle."
 accessible_lab_tooltip: "The plans for your laboratory will only be dictated by what is most efficient but your secrets will not be as well guarded."
 very_hidden_lab_tooltip: "Though isolated your laboratory can be as big as it needs to be."
 
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0002.t: "Build Laboratory: Setup"
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0002.desc: "In order to properly heat and transform metals or other substances I require furnaces of differing temperature and flames of different types. The alchemical texts speak of various setups that could be beneficial."
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0002.a: "A modest setup with one furnace will be enough."
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0002.b: ""
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0002.c: ""
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0002.d: ""
 cheap_laboratory_setup: "[ROOT.GetFullName] will aim for a small but functional laboratory."

 large_laboratory_setup: "[Root.GetFullName] will aim to build an advanced laboratory, capable of handling a number of complicated procedures."
 extravagant_laboratory_setup: "[Root.GetFullName] will build an experimental setup with as many furnaces, basins, and other contraptions as can reasonably be fitted."
 
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0003.t: "Build Laboratory: Flasks, Alembics, etc."
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0003.desc: "The glass in which I keep my concoctions is brittle and breaks easily. This may be tolerable for beakers and other dispensable glass but earlier today a giant alembic shattered into a thousand pieces after having been heated carelessly by one of my helpers..."
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0003.a: "Let us try to limit their use then."
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0003.b: "We must only ever buy the most expensive and durable glass."
 non_fancy_laboratory_glass_tooltip: "[Root.GetFullName] will keep buying glass of inferior quality but helpers will be instructed to handle it with extreme care from now on."
 fancy_laboratory_glass_tooltip: "[Root.GetFullName] will from now on spend more to ensure all glass that enter the laboratory is as durable and clear as possible."
 
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0004.t: "Build Laboratory: Crucibles"
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0004.desc: "Not all pottery is suited for the kind of alchemical work I do. My experiments require both the porous orange pottery that can absorb components in the crucible and the dark and highly fire resistant pots in which even the strongest metal can be melted. Good quality does come at a high price however..."
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0004.a: "In time locals will rise to this challenge."
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0004.b: "Only the best will be good enough!"
 non_fancy_laboratory_crucibles_tooltip: "[Root.GetFullName] will keep the laboratory supplied using the pottery from local potters to avoid the high price of imported crucibles."
 fancy_laboratory_crucibles_tooltip: "[Root.GetFullName] will now only tolerate the best of imported pottery from master potters."
 
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0005.t: "Build Laboratory: Tools"
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0005.desc: "The local smiths do not seem to appreciate the great care that must be taken to create the kind of tools we need to work the fires of my laboratory. Perhaps in time they will learn but so far the results have been most disappointing."

 ancient_magic_alchemy.0006.t: "Build Laboratory: Books"
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0006.desc: "Sometimes the difference identifying success can be as hard as achieving it. Many metals and other substances are so alike that only an expert can tell them apart. To avoid mishaps perhaps it would be best to invest in a rich library of reference literature to avoid unwelcome surprises."
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0006.a: "The books I have will be quite enough."
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0006.b: "My librarians shall not rest until we have such a collection."

 ancient_magic_alchemy.0007.t: "Build Laboratory: Spellcircles"
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0007.desc: "As this laboratory will be used to conduct magical experiments and even magical forging, its imperative that this lab has some spellcircles, that will control the flow of mana, humidity and other environmental factors that could lead to failures. Also cirles that would make sure that forger/alchemist is safe against potentialy dangerous side-effects from currently worked projects."
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0007.a: "Few basic spellcirles will be enough."
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0007.b: "I shall invest into much more intricate setup."

This office of alchemy allows the [Root.GetTitle] to perform any experiment that has so far been documented and is a testament to [Root.GetHerHis] great ambitions in the field."
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0012.a: "As Above, So Below"
    
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0013.t: "Finished Laboratory - The House of Alchemy and Magic"
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0013.desc: "With no expenses spared and under the constant supervision of [Root.GetFullName] a house unlike any other has been erected to realize the dream of a perfect alchemical working environment. Many of the contraptions have been conceived and drawn by the [Root.GetTitle] personally and the great number of furnaces alone employs a team of helpers from all the entire realm.\n\nThe office now stands ready to allow [Root.GetFullName] to uncover the secrets of the world, all it requires is for its master to give the instructions."
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0013.a: "Time to get to work!"
 
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0014.t: "Build Laboratory: Thief!"
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0014.desc: "The entire castle just shook, waking me from the dreamless sleep that comes after hours of preparatory laboratory work. Did I forget to properly lock the laboratory?"

 ancient_magic_alchemy.0015.t: "Build Laboratory: "
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0015.desc: "To the ignorant laboratory equipment can appear both frightening and alien. Word has gotten out of some of the unusual contraptions that have been built for my laboratory. A small mob has assembled outside, demanding answers about why I am constructing so clearly ungodly things."
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0015.a: "I must try to accommodate them.;Je dois essayer de les accommoder."
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0015.b: "Why listen to rabble?"
 accomodate_gossipers_tooltip: "[Root.GetFullName] will make changes to [Root.GetHerHis] laboratory to placate the frightened locals rather than to increase efficiency."
  
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0016.t: "Build Laboratory: "
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0016.desc: "Disaster has struck! An increasingly foul stench from the kitchen area made the guards investigate my stores of alchemical ingredients. I have been focusing so much on the work of assembling my laboratory that the ingredients have begun to rot!"
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0016.a: "Save what can be saved."
 ancient_magic_alchemy.0016.a: "We must build a better storage for the future!"
 random_ingredients_are_destroyed_tooltip: "Random rottable ingredient is destroyed!"
