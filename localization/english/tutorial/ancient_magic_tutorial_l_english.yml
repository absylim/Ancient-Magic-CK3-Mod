  # Magical studies
  ancient_magic_advancement_lesson: "Learn to Study Magic"
  ancient_magic_advancement_lesson_step_1: "Open the Magic Studies window"
  ancient_magic_advancement_lesson_desc: "Your current playable character has [magic_potential|E]! Depending on your religion, this can be both a good thing and a bad thing. Mostly, however, it's a good thing.\n\nWhile exciting, their potential does not actually serve any purpose unless they learn to #EMP use#! said potential. For that to happen, you need to open the Magical Studies window."
  ancient_magic_advancement_lesson_step_2: "The Magic Studies window"
  ancient_magic_advancement_lesson_2_desc: "Welcome to the Magical Studies window! This tutorial box is probably covering a good portion of it - sorry about that - but this window will be how your character learns new spells, increases their maximum mana and their mana regeneration, and just generally disrespects anyone with a religion that has the Witchcraft Criminal doctrine."
  ancient_magic_advancement_lesson_step_3: "Begin Studying Magic"
  ancient_magic_advancement_lesson_3_desc: "To begin learning magic, the character needs to study magic. They do so while they have the Studying Magic modifier, which is obtained by clicking on the Begin Studying Magic button.\n\nBe aware that magical studies take time, so while your character is studying magic, they will gain no passive experience toward their selected vanilla lifestyle.\n\nHowever, due to the fact that they are still expected to uphold their day-to-day responsibilities to the realm, they may still obtain experience or perks from vanilla events concerning those responsibilities."
  ancient_magic_advancement_lesson_step_4: "Obtain the Mage Perk"
  ancient_magic_advancement_lesson_4_desc: "Now that your character is studying magic, they have to actually #EMP use#! some magic in order to study it and gain experience. The first spell that they will learn, [spark_spell|E], is obtained by selecting the Mage perk, which should be marked by a small, glowing star in the center of the night sky.\n\nIf it's hard to spot, be sure to look for this: @icon_magic_perk_available!"

  # Spellcasting
  ancient_magic_spellbook_lesson: "Learn to Cast Spells"
  ancient_magic_spellbook_lesson_step_1: "Open The Spellbook"
  ancient_magic_spellbook_lesson_desc: "Your character has learned a spell! Them knowing how to use the spell doesn't do much good, though, if you don't know how.\n\nAll spells are cast by using the spellbook. You can open the spellbook in two ways: either right-click on a character and select 'Cast a spell' or click on the highlighted icon to select yourself as the target."
  ancient_magic_spellbook_lesson_step_2: "Select The Magic School"
  ancient_magic_spellbook_lesson_2_desc: "Welcome to the spellbook! This window contains most of the information you need to know about your spellcasting: your [mage_level|E], current experience towards your next level, the spells (divided by [school_of_magic|E]), a description of the spell selected, the current spell target, the spells effects, the ability to cast the spell, and your current and maximum [mana|E].\n\nTo cast a spell, first you must select which school the magic is in. Likely the only spell you have access to, [spark_spell|E], is a basic spell, which you can view when the Basic tab, the one with the open book, is selected."
  ancient_magic_spellbook_lesson_step_3: "Select Your First Spell"
  ancient_magic_spellbook_lesson_3_desc: "Now that you've selected the school, select the [spark_spell|E]."
  ancient_magic_spellbook_lesson_step_4: "Cast The Spell"
  ancient_magic_spellbook_lesson_4_desc: "With the spell selected, you can see its description, its effects, and a new, smaller window that contains properties specific to the chosen spell, if any. [spark_spell|E] allows you to cast it multiple times at once, to avoid the need to open the spellbook just to cast it over and over. If you have the mana to cast it more than once, you can select to cast it more times, and the effects will change accordingly. When you are done, press the highlighted button to cast the spell."
