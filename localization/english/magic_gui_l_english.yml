 ## Spell Descs
 #error catching
 dummy_spell_desc: ""

 #Time
 glimpse_the_future_spell_desc: "This spell allows the user brief insights into the future of their culture, allowing them to view new innovations and technologies. Gives a bonus to [cultural_fascination|E] research speed."
 financial_times_spell_desc: "A more directed application of future sight, this spell allows the user to see specific events, such as resource abundances or shortages, well in advance, allowing them to gain a market advantage. Gives a bonus to monthly [income|E]."
 celerity_spell_desc: "A relatively simple application of [chronomancy|E], this spell allows the user to increase the flow of time around themselves, giving them extraordinarily fast reaction times. Best used in short bursts, so as not to age oneself too quickly. Gives a bonus to [prowess|E]."
 mass_celerity_spell_desc: "More powerful than [celerity_spell|E], this spell gives the user the fine control necessary to greatly speed up a group of their own soldiers, even in the middle of heated combat. Gives a bonus to [advantage|E] and friendly [dead_soldiers|E] reduction."
 slowness_spell_desc: "The equal but opposite form of [celerity_spell|E], this spell allows the user to decrease the flow of time around a target, making them seem to move at a snail's pace. Gives the target a penalty to [prowess|E]. Must be revoked from a target before being cast on a different target."
 mass_slowness_spell_desc: "More powerful than [slowness_spell|E], not as powerful as [haste_spell|E], this spell gives the user enough fine control to slow enemy soldiers under a given commander, even in the middle of pitched battle. Gives a penalty to [advantage|E] and an enemy [dead_soldiers|E] increase."
 temporal_manipulation_spell_desc: "The true successor to [celerity_spell|E], this spell allows the user to increase the flow of time around a specific area, allowing tasks to be performed at a much faster rate. Gives a bonus to [building|E] construction speed."
 haste_spell_desc: "Contrary to the name, this spell is actually a more powerful version of [slowness_spell|E]. Instead of slowing a single target, the mage slows all but a select group. While those affected still move at a normal speed, they appear to be moving at great speed. Gives a bonus to army movement speed."
 master_of_time_spell_desc: "Having mastered the nuances of time's flow, this spell allows the user to completely halt the passage of time for another person, while still allowing them to interact with the world as normal. Makes the target [GetTrait('immortal').GetName(GetNullCharacter)]."

 # Life
 heal_spell_desc: "The most basic application of [chiromancy|E], this spell increases the speed of the body's natural healing processes: sealing wounds, increasing blood production, and bolstering immune system strength. Effectively heals the target of any single common affliction."
 greater_heal_spell_desc: "A more advanced application of [chiromancy|E], this spell uses mana directly to seal wounds, replace blood, destroy infections, etc., and so can be used to heal more dangerous illnesses. Effectively heals the target of any single common or dangerous affliction."
 avatar_of_life_spell_desc: "The most advanced application of [chiromancy|E], this spell uses pure magical power to replace organs and blood, annihilate infectious invaders, and even target diseases the body doesn't recognize as diseases. Effectively heals the target of any single affliction."

 # Necromancy
 inflict_illness_spell_desc: "This basic [necromancy|E] spell acts upon its subject's immune system, diminishing it in ways which leave the target vulnerable to all manner of illnesses which they would normally be able to fight off. Makes the target [GetTrait('ill').GetName(GetNullCharacter)]."
 plague_lord_spell_desc: "A more concentrated form of [inflict_illness_spell|E], the practioner is able to engineer a truly virulent and deadly plague. This plague has very high lethality, and is able to spread from one victim to another, killing droves. Gives the target the [GetTrait('bubonic_plague').GetName(GetNullCharacter)]."
 aura_of_death_spell_desc: "[necromancy|E] is a dangerous [school_of_magic|E]. Living things can feel this at a visceral level. Among the simplest of all aura spells, the necromancer's 'aura of death' doesn't do anything particularly flashy. All a practioner needs to do in order to cast this spell is to place themselves in the state of mind required to cast a necromancy spell. This voluntary madness, and the energies associated with it, produce a pervasive sense of unease in anyone near the spell caster."
 necromancy_spell_desc: "This spell is the quintessential [necromancy|E] ritual. In order to cast the spell, the necromancer must extend their madness out into the world, pressing it upon the bodies of the deceased, and then exerting their will, denying death as a certainty so completely that reality shifts, molding itself to the madness of the caster.\n\nTo achieve this obscene ritual, even the most powerful of [GetTrait('mage').GetName( GetNullCharacter ) |LVl]s require a number of physical spell mnemonics, usually in the form of a ritual dagger, which has been placed in the funeral pyres of hundreds of the recently deceased, and often, a number of assitants to help with various elements of the ritual."
 drain_life_spell_desc: "This infamous spell is among the most evil of spells known in any [school_of_magic|E]. It draws on the corrosive, destructive, and hungry nature of [necromancy|E], using that nature to drain the life-force of the spell's target and feed it back into its caster. If the caster exerts more will, they may even drain the target so quickly that the victim expires immediately, though this approach disperses the victim's life-force so rapdily that the caster is unable to consume it."
