#Desc: Every being has some mana affinity which states how their body is affected by mana, 
#beings with higher mana affinity can store much more mana in their cells can more easily access it

###################
# Affinity levels:
###################
# 0 - 5: mortal (mundane being with near no magical talents: normal humans, animals)
mundane_mana_affinity_level = 5
# 5 - 10: sub-magical (Beings that sometimes have some nutural born magical abbilities: Sorcerers, sub-magical beasts)
sub_magical_mana_affinity_level = 10
# 10 - 15: magical (Beings born with some megical talents: Elves, Goblins, Megical Beasts)
magical_mana_affinity_level = 15
# 15 - 20: Loved by mana (High Elves)
loved_mana_affinity_level = 20
# 20 - 25: Demigod (Being that can control mana just like breating: Ancient Dragons, Angels, Demons and etc.)
demigod_mana_affinity_level = 25
# 25 - 30: Godly (ones body is nearly made out of mana)
